# MyReads Project

This is continuation of the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.
The app uses React & react-router to build an front-end for a RESTful books API. It can search for books, add books to shelves, and move them between shelves.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* run tests with `npm run test`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## TDD included

I am using Jest & Enzyme for writing tests. Unforunatelly not all components are covered with tests.

## TODO

* I would like to cover all components with Unit Testing in the nearest future.
* Improve styling.
* Add transitions when components change.
